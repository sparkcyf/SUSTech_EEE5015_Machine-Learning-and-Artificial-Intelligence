For images provided in the attached file (data01.zip), make a partition to form a training set, a validation set, and a test set. Use at least two approaches (or networks) to classify the images into two categories (One indicates that the ground is empty and the other indicates that the ground has something on it). Try different hyper-parameters on the two approaches, demonstrate how well your algorithms are in terms of recall, precision, and F1 score, and make some comments according to your own understanding about the results. Write in .ipynb file with necessary markdown documentation. You are required to do it by yourself only, which means that no two hand-in solutions shall have exactly the same two approaches.  

to solve the question above from scratch using, how could i choose the nn network and design the network structure, please think it carefully and give me some specific advices (no need to present too much code).

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach the given problem. I'll provide you with two specific network architectures to use for classification and general advice on designing the network structure.

1. Data partitioning:
Split the dataset into training (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) sets. Ensure that the split is stratified so that the distribution of the two categories is maintained in all the sets.

2. Data preprocessing:
Normalize the images by scaling pixel values to the range [0, 1]. You can also perform data augmentation techniques such as rotation, horizontal flipping, and zooming to increase the diversity of the dataset and improve model generalization.

3. Network architecture selection:
Choose two different network architectures to classify the images. For this example, we will use a simple custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a pre-trained network using Transfer Learning (e.g., ResNet50).

4. Custom CNN architecture:
- Input layer
- Conv2D (32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation)
- MaxPooling2D (2x2 pool size)
- Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation)
- MaxPooling2D (2x2 pool size)
- Conv2D (128 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation)
- MaxPooling2D (2x2 pool size)
- Flatten
- Dense (256 neurons, ReLU activation, Dropout 0.5)
- Dense (1 neuron, Sigmoid activation)

5. Transfer Learning with ResNet50:
- Load the pre-trained ResNet50 model without the top layers
- Add custom layers on top:
  - Flatten
  - Dense (256 neurons, ReLU activation, Dropout 0.5)
  - Dense (1 neuron, Sigmoid activation)
- Freeze the layers of the pre-trained ResNet50 model (optional)

6. Hyperparameter tuning:
Experiment with different hyperparameters for both approaches, such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer, dropout rate, etc.

7. Model training and validation:
Train the models using the training set and validate them using the validation set. Monitor the training and validation loss and accuracy.

8. Model evaluation:
Evaluate the models on the test set using metrics such as recall, precision, and F1 score. Compare the performance of the two approaches.

9. Comments and conclusions:
Analyze the results, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches. The custom CNN might be faster to train but may have lower performance than the pre-trained ResNet50 model, which can benefit from the knowledge learned from a larger dataset. Transfer learning is often more effective when dealing with limited data.

Remember to document all these steps in a Jupyter Notebook, using markdown cells to provide explanations and code cells to run the necessary code.

please help me write a pytorch NN class according to the advices above, the input image size is 3(RGB channel)*555*793

Sure, here is a PyTorch implementation of the custom CNN architecture based on the advice above. Note that you may need to adjust the kernel sizes, strides, or padding to match the specific input dimensions of your dataset.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class CustomCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CustomCNN, self).__init__()
        
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.pool1 = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu2 = nn.ReLU()
        self.pool2 = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu3 = nn.ReLU()
        self.pool3 = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(128 * 69 * 99, 256)  # Adjust these dimensions based on the output size after pooling
        self.relu4 = nn.ReLU()
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)
        
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, 1)
        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool1(self.relu1(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool2(self.relu2(self.conv2(x)))
        x = self.pool3(self.relu3(self.conv3(x)))
        
        x = self.flatten(x)
        
        x = self.dropout(self.relu4(self.fc1(x)))
        x = self.sigmoid(self.fc2(x))
        
        return x

# Example usage
model = CustomCNN()
print(model)

# Define your loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
```

This code defines a PyTorch `nn.Module` class for the custom CNN architecture. Remember that you might need to adjust the dimensions in the fully connected layer (`self.fc1`) based on the output size after pooling. You can calculate the output dimensions by checking the output shapes at each step.

You can use this class to train the custom CNN model on your dataset. Make sure to preprocess the data and split it into training, validation, and test sets, as mentioned in the previous response.
